        here are few tips
            filename
                you can directly specify the filename that to be ignored.
            *.log
                you can ignore the file with this particular extentions files. you change the extention according to you.
                To exclude particular .log extention file from ignoring you can add:
                    !filename.log
                    
            foldername/
                by specifing the folder name you can ignore all the file inside the folder.
    Ater specifing the file in .gitignore
        commit the .gitignore
            git commit -am "adding git ignore file"
    now you are ready to go
    Note: this ignoring will we applicable to specific directory only which has .gitignore
    
   To ignore the globly we can do:
   git config --global core.execluesgfile ~/.gitignore
            give the exact location of .gitignore file
=================================================================================================================================
Untrack a tracked file.
    modify the file.
    git rm --cached filename
    git status
        it say file is deleted but it is deleting only from git repro not from local repo
    git commit -am "ignoring the filename from tracking"
